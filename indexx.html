         <p> If you want to remain at the cutting edge of what you are doing, you need to understand what the cutting edge concept says; 
             the concept says that small difference in your skills, your ability, and your talent will lead to enormous difference in your
             outcome, in your result or delivery ( <span ><b>John Maxwell</b></span> )
        </p>
        <p> Your certificate and qualification is beautiful and simply necessary but 
            is not sufficient, what is sufficient is your attitude because your attitude will determine your altitude.                              
            Life is all about performance, if you want to look for synonyms for these performance you will be looking at 
            synonyms like productivity or effectiveness. Effectiveness is the ability to produce the desired result in every
            endeavor you found yourself. The first and one thing any organization will do to drive performance is sitting down
            at the level of the management to cast vision and write their mission statement all these can be done in a threat 
            or through brainstorming just to come up with a co-operate culture and other to coin out a perfect core value or 
            shared value for the organization. At instiq we have all these co-operate culture which drive our performance, you don’t
             need an epistle all you need is just one word, that why when we say instiq; I BELIEVE. Believe is our culture we don’t want 
             anybody to paint a picture of impossibilities we believe everything is possible. Our mindset at instiq is I did very well 
             yesterday I must do better and greater today, we won’t rest until our good is better and our better is best that our drive,
              we move to the best of the best performance in everything we do. Our core value is STRIVE the component of our core value is 
              Service, Trust, Relationship, Integrity, Value, and Excellence. At instiq we value ourselves and we value one another because
               the truth of the matter is if you don’t value people within you can’t render excellent service outside.</p>
         <p> We will be looking at these component one by one. The first component we will treat is service. What is service?
             Jack Welch was the chairman and CEO of GE (General Electricity) for twenty years between 1981-2001. He told the world that 
            “Companies cannot protect jobs, only satisfied customers can do that. Keeping customer is more advantageous than looking for a customer.
            He explain further that service is more effective at enhancing the volumes of sales, when volumes of sales is enhance profit will be enhance
            what retain the customers you were able to generate through sales promotion is an excellent and good service. The touch of Good and excellent
             service is what keeps enhancing your sales and profit.</p>

          <h5 class="indigo-text text-darken-4">WHY CUSTOMERS LEAVE ORGANISATION</h5>
          <p>Research has made us to understand that:
          <ol>
              <li><b>1% dies:</b>	 maybe one percent of your customer’s dies you can’t determine if a customer dies or not.</li>
              <li> <b>3% move away: </b>these can happen if one of your loyal customers migrate to another country which you can’t stop them.</li>
              <li><b>	9% leave for competitive reason: which is normal because as an organization you are not cut out to serve everybody.</li>
              <li><b>	9% leave for competitive reason:</b> which is normal because as an organization you are not cut out to serve everybody.</li>
              <li><b> 14% are dissatisfied because of the product:</b> at this point you need to be sensitive and do something about it.</li>
              <li><b>68% go elsewhere because of the poor way they were treated by the employee of the company</b></li>
            </p>
          </ol>
          <p>The last two issues are preventable especially the 68% is very avoidable and they carry the larger percent, 
            imagine you loosing 82% of your customers to issues that are within your control then there is problem.
             It is very important that you take care of issues around this last two percent. Management theory says 
             there are three things that will makes an organization works which are:
             <ol type="i">
               <li>Process</li>
               <li>Technology</li>
               <li>The people</li>
             </ol>
          </p>
          <p> Among these 3 management theory the most critical of it allis the people because if you have the best process 
             people can come and destroy the process, if you implement the best technology you will still rely on people to 
             enable or disable the technology. That is why organization need to concentrate more on the people side of the organization.

            <h2 class="indigo-text text-darken-4">WHAT IS EXCELLENT SERVICE</h2>
            <p>Customer perception minus customer expectation. The battle for repeat business is critical to long-term success in today’s
               intensely competitive market place. Customers service is not just a competitive edge service is the new standard by which 
               customers judge performance. Having these at the back of your mind you will not render anything short of quality excellent 
               service to your customers meaning you have to serve your customer with a smile on your face even when things don’t go right
                with you. It means going the extra mile when someone is in need of your help, it means caring for your client and co-worker.
                 If all you do is to care for your client that is hypocrisy. Excellent serviceisall about surprising a customer with a random 
                 act of kindness. It means following up with a courtesy phone call after you’ve put things right. Service is better define by 
                 meeting the functions such as:
                 <ol type="i">
                   <li>	It helps you maintain old customers</li>
                   <li>	It attract new customers</li>
                   <li>	Leaving all customers with an impression of inducement to do business with the organization again and again.</li>
                 </ol>
